# Heyo!

My GitHub profile acts as both a portfolio and a playground for my personal coding projects.

My goals:
- Be more "Out there" with my personal projects so i can gather public feedback on my work and improve as a developer.
- Make my development processes more transparent for others to see.
- Doing the above in the name of fun and personal development!
